  At Horadent, we are specialists in avant-garde dental implantology. We offer you advice, planning and complete financing to put the use of implants within your reach.

  This solution is a breakthrough because it allows to recover the functionality and aesthetics of the teeth lost as a result of diseases or extractions. Not only does it allow the use of the complete denture in a safe way, but it also allows our patients to recover their old smile.

  When carrying out an implant, an analysis must be performed to determine the feasibility and approach for each patient. We offer close and personal advice so that you do not have any doubts during the whole process.

  The realization of an implant is divided into three distinct stages: study, implant placement and crown placement.

  During the study phase, the analysis of the area where the implant is to be performed is performed, as well as a series of additional tests to confirm the viability of the implant.

  In the second phase, after having obtained a favorable study for the realization of the implant, the surgical stage of the process begins. For this, an invasive procedure will be carried out to place the implant on which, later, the dental crown will be established.

  After this, a period of three to six months is required for the implant to be properly anchored on the bone.

  Finally, the dental crown will be developed and placed on the implant. Once the crown has been created, it can be cemented or screwed onto the implant itself.
