  Within our wide range of treatments, from Horadent Dental Clinic, we offer endodontics with previous study of the situation and needs. Our goal is to offer the best solution and ensure the most accurate and successful treatment possible.

  The main causes of the need for endodontics are caries and large fillings.

  A root canal is the treatment of the canals of the tooth. Within the tooth structure is the dental pulp, which is a set of veins and internal nerves that give sensitivity and vitality to our teeth.

  Cavities, by causing weakness in the dentin, leave part of the pulp unprotected, which can generate problems that lead to the need for root canals if the cavities are not treated in time.

  Due to cases like this, it is recommended to make regular visits to the dentist's office to prevent avoidable problems with early detection.

  In the case of large fillings, they can cause the dental pulp to retract due to the invasion of the filling into the dental area. In more serious cases, necrosis and infection can occur in the absence of treatment.

  The diagnosis is carried out by means of an analysis in order to determine the magnitude of the problem and choose the best solution for the patient.

  After this, we proceed with the exploration of the area, x-rays to establish the affectation.

  Finally, we proceed to perform the endodontics itself to solve the problem as soon as possible.

  There are more complicated situations in which the process takes longer due to the appearance of infections in the affected area. Therefore, before starting the treatment, you should wait and treat the infection to avoid major problems.
