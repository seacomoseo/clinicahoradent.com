  In certain cases, it is necessary to correct alterations in dental development to avoid problems, not only aesthetic, but also health problems for our patients. Because a medium/severe alteration can lead to a series of problems such as overbite or inverted bite in the most visibly severe cases or diastemas that can increase the risk of periodontal disease.

  The use of orthodontics, as we can see, goes beyond the simple repositioning for the improvement of dental esthetics, but prevents and avoids real problems of great magnitude such as those mentioned above.

  For this, it is important to carry out a study of the specific needs, to be able to offer a solution adapted to their health and aesthetics while taking into account the greatest possible comfort for our clients.
